# PowerTrello
PowerTrello is a PowerShell module for interacting with the Trello web service.

## How to Use

1. Sign up for an API key and secret for your Trello subscription [here](https://trello.com/app-key).

2. Open up your PowerShell console as administrator.

3. Download the PowerTrello module from the PowerShell Gallery.

   `Install-Module PowerTrello`

4. Retrieve a token from Trello and save to a variable.

  `$token = Request-TrelloAccessToken –ApiKey MYAPIKEY`

5. Save the token and API key to the registry so you don't have to specify it every time.

  `Set-TrelloConfiguration –ApiKey MYAPIKEY –AccessToken $token`

6. Make the Trello configuration available in your current PowerShell session.

  `Get-TrelloConfiguration`

7. Run any of the functions in the module to interact with your Trello boards. For example, just to ensure you can communicate with Trello, run the `Get-TrelloBoard` function. This function should return all of your Trello boards.
